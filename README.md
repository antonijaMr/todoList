# To-Do List

## About

This app is a to-do list. You can use it to track your to-do-s. It is created to be very simple and easy to use. 
This is my first project where I used react-native. 

You can use it to add new tasks, remove ones you have done and see all your remaining tasks.

[Here is presentation where you can see how this app looks.](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFfCfgdhW8/jUTfBXvBZIpe0e5DTLx-Gw/view?utm_content=DAFfCfgdhW8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink)
